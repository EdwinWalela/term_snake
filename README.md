# term_snake

As the name suggests this is a snake game that runs on the terminal built using C.
It's a small project I did as I was learning C and terminal stuff. I did it right after completing part one and two of the [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial.

## How to compile and run

Run the following command:
```
make run
```
You need to have ``gcc `` compiler to use the above command.

You can compile with any other C compiler that supports c99
